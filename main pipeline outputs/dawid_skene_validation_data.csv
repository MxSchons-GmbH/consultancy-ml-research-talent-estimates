"Experiences: Magic (Talent and Ops): Magic is building frontier code models to automate software engineering and research.  We believe the most promising path to safe AGI is to automate AI research and code generation to improve models and solve alignment more reliably than humans can alone. Our approach is to combine frontier-scale pre-training, domain-specific reinforcement learning, ultra-long context, and inference-time compute to achieve this goal.  To support our mission, we have 8,000 H100s and raised $515 million from Nat Friedman, Daniel Gross, CapitalG, Elad Gil, Sequoia, Jane Street, Eric Schmidt and others.  We are a small group of engineers and researchers working to solve a short list of fundamental research problems on a direct path to AGI. If this sounds interesting, we would love to hear from you.  Fun Fact:  We are going to make Fetch happen 🤘 | Mallery LLP (CEO and Co-Founder): Principal, majority stakeholder and primary goal-setter.  Company highlights... Born in a log cabin in Montana Elementary school in Minnesota High School and college in Vegas (Yes, that Vegas!)  World travel: Greece, France, Spain, Belgium, Austria, Germany, Italy, Czech, Egypt, Mexico... does Canada count??  US Travel:  There are a couple states I haven't visited, but we'll get there soon!  And Last but certainly #1... My Loving Family:  Wife - Kelly Sons - Martin and Lucas 2 dogs and 2 cats... the cats only love me when the dogs are sleeping  Fun Fact: Still trying to make ""fetch"" happen. | OpenAI (Member of Talent Staff): OpenAI is an AI research and deployment company. The company’s mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity. I joined the team to drive improvements in engineering hiring across the org and help OpenAI add core engineering, infrastructure, and software capabilities. Joined when the team was 170 people and helped grow to over 400.  Fun highlights: Sole recruiter responsible for SWE recruiting in 2022  After our Supercomputing team was unable to hire anyone during the previous year with multiple offers rejected, I worked with the head of the team to address a burning organizational need and added 5 hires (zero turndowns) and a new Engineering Manager to build OpenAI's next generation of compute infrastructure  Our Applied AI Engineering team was around a dozen engineers reporting to one Manager in Q2 2022. From May 2022 to February 2023, we added 4 Engineering Managers and around 2 dozen engineers to this team. Along the way, they launched DALL-E and ChatGPT, so that was pretty cool 🤗  Hired the founding engineering team for new Human Data initiative led by one of our co-founders  Recognized a glaring gap in team culture and singlehandedly (with the help of one other) spearheaded the founding of the first company Fantasy Football League... OAI FFL. Side-note: While my team, ""AGI Monkeys"", was severely hampered by the lack of production from its first round pick (Jonathan Taylor), the rest of his teammates fought valiantly and proudly  Took over Security hiring in September 2022 and added 5 new members to the team  Was responsible for hiring all Software Engineers in 2022 for our Research Acceleration, Codegen, Alignment, Science of Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Scaling teams  15 hires in 2 months of 2023 was most on the team  Fun Fact: Unable to make ""fetch"" happen 😜 | AI Foundation (VP of Talent and Collaborations): At AI Foundation, our goal was to give everyone their own, personal AI. We built technology that enabled real-time, digital humans and it was an interesting, early swing at AGI. Ironically, it was the deep-fake detection technology designed as a safeguard to our core product that has turned out to be the most successful thing we built. This technology and part of the team was spun out and eventually became one of the leading companies (Reality Defender) in the fight to protect users in an ever-increasing AI world. Much of the AFI team was acqui-hired by a leading chatbot company (LivePerson). I decided to take a larger swing at AGI and join a different, eventually well known, ""chatbot"" company 😉  Fun fact: Was employee number 5 and still the second ""Rob M"" | Originate (VP of Talent): Building Originate was a super fun initiative and my first time creating a ""honeypot"" company where people don't just ""take jobs"" but join for the people, the culture and the mission. I was brought in by the CEO as the 12th employee to build and foster this unique culture.  Our aim was equal parts venture firm/startup incubator/accelerator/ and founding-style software product development engine. We worked every day to create the environment where the best people in the world would want to work, be builders and spin out new ventures.  Together with the Founder/CEO, I led the recruitment of a team of nearly 200 of the finest Engineers, Designers, Product Managers and Business/Venture professionals. The team we assembled had technical expertise in Go, React, Scala, Haskell, Node.js, DevOps, iOS, Android, machine-learning and everything in between. If Originate couldn't build it, it was probably unbuildable 😜  Our culture of technical innovation, venture, and entrepreneurism included unique offerings such as:  - 50% profit sharing for everyone on the team - A very unique 20% Time that allowed employees to work on startups, open-source projects, and charitable projects while keeping all IP for themselves. - Open and flexible work environments for maximum productivity.  Fun Fact: Even as employee #12, I was still the second ""Rob""... also the second ""Rob M"". | Lassen Group (Founder): I was a founding partner and day to day operations / sales manager for Lassen while also being the top biller for the office. We performed F/T perm technical placement services for companies in Orange County and Los Angeles needing to hire the best software engineers.  Primary areas of expertise were Software and Web Development (.NET, Java, C++, PHP, Ruby on Rails). I hired and trained all staff - primarily entry-level college graduates who wanted a career mixing sales, technology and helping people.  Fun fact: I also met my wife here, so that was pretty cool | Zion Partners (Recruiter): Did the do. || Certifications: || Education: – @ University of Nevada-Las Vegas | – @ Bonanza High School || Summary: I'm a nerd about people, AI, the future of work and any combination that allows humans to be their best selves.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I introduced ROKS, a stablecoin exclusively used for cross-border money transfers, in 2022. If you want to send money to the Philippines, you can use ROKS - just go to https://sendroks.com. Your recipient needs to install the ROKS wallet, which makes it very simple to convert ROKS to PHP. Try it!  I will be introducing a new kind of stablecoin in Solana. Unlike all USD-backed stablecoins which will all inflate with USD, this new kind of stablecoin will not inflate with USD. It's called IRMA - Inflation Resistant Medium of Account. Message me if you are curious about IRMA.  IRMA will be reserve-backed by the top six stablecoins in Solana: FDUSD, PYUSD, USDC, USDE, USDG, and USDT. This means that, even if USD does not inflate too much, IRMA would be very useful as a ""universal stablecoin"" that seamlessly and almost frictionlessly converts to/from the top six stablecoins. IRMA is the ultimate medium of exchange in DeFi. You won't need any other stablecoin in your wallet. I am actively looking for investors and if you're looking for a stablecoin issuer to invest in, you're in luck because my startup Rock Stable has not accepted any formal investment. If you've found better inflation-resistant solutions elsewhere, I'd love to hear about it. The moat for IRMA is that it is patent pending. IRMA is open-source, but it is protected.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(Grant Round Facilitator): Managing the logistics and communications for Survival and Flourishing Grant Rounds. | Survival and Flourishing Corp. (Grant Round Facilitator): Managing the logistics and communications for Survival and Flourishing Grant Rounds. | Survival and Flourishing Corp. (Standing recommender): I help investigate organizations that have applied for funding, to inform the Survival and Flourishing Fund's grant decisions. | Atlas Fellowship (Instructor): | Center for Applied Rationality (Instructor, Content Developer): CFAR is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that runs a variety of programs aiming to increase the quality of the epistemology around AI risk, via recruiting, training, and culture-setting.  We run workshops in conjunction with the Machine Intelligence Research Institute for recruiting talented computer scientists and mathematicians, helping those who are a good fit transition towards working on technical AI safety. CFAR also runs a mainline workshop to which anyone can apply, where we teach many of the tools we've developed, and help people think clearly about the problems and opportunities in their life. There are ~15000 alumni of the mainline workshop, and many of those have continued to engage with the broader EA and rationality community. The mainline workshop is an important anchor of the epistemic culture around MIRI, and some parts of AI safety.  I teach at, and have developed curriculum for, all of CFAR's main programs including the mainline workshop, MSFP, and AIRCS. I also designed and led CFAR's 2019 instructor training.  In addition to workshops, I have done work on rationality development, specializing in methods for resolving deep disagreements of intuition, and efficient tacit knowledge transfer more generally.  My basic development loop involves: - Identifying a problem that seems to be bottlenecking progress on some important dimension.  - Exploring the literature (if it exists) and other existing resources that are relevant to this domain and/or generating hypotheses for how to solve or circumvent the core problem. - Running 2 to 8 person test sessions with volunteers, noticing where and how my intervention is failing, and iteratively trying to patch those problems. - Deploying those tools, either by teaching the relevant researchers the cognitive skill directly, or by personally facilitating a process for them.  My sense of ""what the problem is"", and what sorts of interventions seem promising, usually changes drastically over the course of this process. | Survival and Flourishing Fund (Grant Evaluator): The Survival and Flourishing Fund is a Donor Advised Fund held at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, funded by Jaan Tallinn. The fund makes grants to organizations working to improve humanity's long term prospects for survival and flourishing. I have done occasional grant assessment for the Survival and Flourishing fund, on a contract basis, since the fund was part of BERI.  This entails interviewing grant applicants and writing assessment and recommendation reports (of varying levels of depth, depending on the project), for the grant making committee. | Berkeley Existential Risk Initiative (Special Projects and HR): BERI is an independent 501(c)(3) public charity that takes on ethical and legal responsibility, as a collaborator, for projects deemed to be important for reducing existential risk. These projects mostly revolve around reducing risk from technologies that may pose significant civilization-scale dangers, as determined by research collaborators who have adopted existential risk reduction as both their primary career ambition and their primary area of intellectual focus.  I filled a variety of roles for BERI as the organization was growing, including: - Interviewing, hiring, and onboarding contractors for several roles supporting researchers at academic x-risk focused orgs. - Basic legal research - Organizing and managing events - Creating an open-use list of prediction market questions on AI outcomes. - Evaluating grant applications, and making recommendations to the grants committee. | Center for Decision Research, Booth School of Business, University of Chicago (Research Assistant): Data collection and data coding of consumer behavior experiments. | Ben Radford (Paranormal Research and Investigation Intern): [Note: I no longer believe extra-physical psychic phenomena exist, and I am confident enough in this view that I don't think investigating parapsychology is very interesting or informative, in most cases.]  Once upon a time, I was seriously interested in parapsychology, psychic phenomena, and the content of ""new-age"" beliefs. I spent much of my teenage years pursuing this fascination and trying to develop my own psychic faculties. When I was 19, I was introduced to the scientific skepticism movement through a T.E.D. talk by James Randi. I had already begun testing the claims of the new-age thought bundle myself, and getting negative results. But I wanted to explore further, so I sought out a professional skeptic an paranormal investigator to intern with.]  Ben Radford is an editor for Skeptical Inquirer Magazine and an independent paranormal investigator, who has written several books on the topic, and who is most famous for having solved the mystery of the Chupacabra.  My work with Ben is largely research, tracking down sources and tracing the history of a claim. Doing your homework is the difference between a legitimate investigation and showing up at a site and declaring how spooky it is. Many cases are solved in the library.  I also worked on live field investigations, interviewing locals, running field-experiments on the fly, recording information. Most notably, I investigated the ""Haunted"" St. James Hotel in New Mexico.  This was classic detective work and investigative journalism. | Friendzy (Special Projects Intern): Friendzy was a Chicago-based start-up with the mission of helping people make friends. We identified the key pain-points and hurdles of the friendship-making process, and developed processes and strategies, and implemented them at our friednzy events, to make those traditional pain-points as smooth and easy as possible. I worked on a number of projects, including developing low-cost, no-tech variants of technological tools (to serve as preliminary tests-of-concept before creating dedicated software), recording procedural variations and outcomes, running events, and writing instructional literature. | Point 180 (Sales Representative): A summer sales job, selling Vonage phones and phone-service in Wallmarts and k-marts.

While maintaining good grades and behaving, I was given a Nintendo Wii for Christmas. Being first introduced to entertainment, I found myself ensued on how these devices and video games have even came to start. I found myself playing customizable games like Super Mario Maker which gave me the ability to personalize video games myself. I found myself wanting to break barriers and traditional norms in video games.  As I began to grow accustomed to technology in everyday life, I began learning new ways to personalize other devices. I grew up with an Android tablet and found ways to root and customize the operating system of the tablet itself to fit my own personal needs and goals at the time. I found that there are ways to make a device more efficient by rooting android. I managed to learn to disable unneeded background tasks that sync information with other apps, and found ways to extend battery life to bring my tablet anywhere I needed to be instead of being stuck at home.  When I began to find work as a teenager, I found myself in the retail space and found a drive for providing the right solution for customers in the technology field. I grew astonished to find many different ways technology was able to assist others that may not be able to. From Live!y service to OTC hearing aids, I found myself interested and tried to think of new ways to get myself involved in the engineering field.  I took on a learning course and project from freecodecamp.org which taught me how to build websites with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I then honed those skills and learned to build a survey, which was built from the ground up with HTML and CSS to create a sense of professionalism, while also making it responsive, and adjust size and padding based on a device's resolution. The survey was meant to record data from a small group of individuals, which would record the biggest challenges they face navigating the internet and other technologies when considering their disabilities. I learned that there's many challenges that people still face regardless of given accessibility options.  I currently have a growing interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, as I, seeing the many accomplishments done with AI, believe that there can be more ways to make technology accessible to everyone, including voice recognition, voice recreation, and easier ways of communication. I'm hoping to develop this skill in order to find new ways to make technology accessible to all.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I knew the difference a PV system and storage solution could make in my household.  When I had the opportunity to study abroad, I chose Appalachian State University for two reasons: they have the oldest renewable energy engineering and sustainable development program in the country, and they have a cycling team. This choice also ignited my other passions—health, fitness, and wellness. Additionally, Boone, NC, is one of the most beautiful mountain towns in the US. Those who have been there will agree.  At my core, I’m a problem solver. I believe no problem exists without a solution, and I love the challenge of finding solutions to audacious problems. Because of this, I’m also a solution architect. Big problems always have multiple moving parts, and solving difficult challenges has made me a highly structured, organized, and data-driven individual.  All of this made me very effective in my previous roles in sales and marketing, operations, engineering, design and installation, communication, business, product, and project development.  It also led me to co-found three organizations—two in renewable energy and one in health, fitness, and wellness. In all the organizations I led, we chose to create bold and exciting new products, services, and solutions rather than copying existing ones to make a quick buck. We engaged with potential users and stakeholders before creating a prototype of the solutions we eventually launched. Building something from nothing while working with an equally passionate cross-functional team provides the greatest highs for me.  I am currently looking for big, hairy problems to solve, preferably in the energy space, but I am open to challenges in the health, fitness, and wellness sectors as well.  I enjoy meeting new people and hearing new perspectives. Reach out if you want to talk to me about the above sectors or cycling.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I never studied them in college, I studied Civil Engineering instead. But during college, I gradually shifted my focus from Civil Engineering to AI. It affected my grades a lot, but I don’t regret it. I chose the right path. I still appreciate my Civil Engineering background. Someone once said something about connecting the dots I don't know if it was Steve Jobs or Elon Musk but I can say for sure: those engineering classes gave me a strong mathematical foundation that made learning and understanding AI much easier. This journey hasn't been easy. It's been full of moments of joy and laughter, but also failure. I’ve failed in two startups, but honestly, I consider startup life a school of thought on its own. Despite the setbacks, my passion for AI has never faded in fact, it’s only deepened.  Today, I’m a graduate student at WorldQuant University, pursuing a Master of Science in Financial Engineering, a path that combines my love for math, AI, and problem-solving in real-world systems. I’m particularly passionate about how AI can uplift the less privileged, and I advocate for explainable, ethical, and responsible AI. My work is rooted in research, and it's through research that I’ve learned the most. Being African, I’ve also observed how underrepresented we are in the global AI conversation. We’re often seen only as consumers, not creators. That needs to change. I’ve written on topics like balancing innovation and regulation, because overregulation can stifle progress especially, in places like Africa where the ecosystem is just beginning to grow.  Currently, I work at MsingiAI, a research lab focused on democratizing AI access in Africa. All of our work is open source. I’ve been championing Open Source AI development in Africa, because I believe it’s the key to wider adoption, inclusion, and innovation across the continent. I don’t know exactly where this path will take me, but I’m optimistic. I love talking about AI, startups, and the African tech landscape. If you're into any of that, feel free to reach out via LinkedIn or email. I’ve got a lot to say probably enough for a book but for now, let me keep it short.  Cheers, Korir",0,1,0,1,0,0,0
