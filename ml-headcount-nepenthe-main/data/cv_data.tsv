I introduced ROKS, a stablecoin exclusively used for cross-border money transfers, in 2022. If you want to send money to the Philippines, you can use ROKS - just go to https://sendroks.com. Your recipient needs to install the ROKS wallet, which makes it very simple to convert ROKS to PHP. Try it!     I will be introducing a new kind of stablecoin in Solana. Unlike all USD-backed stablecoins which will all inflate with USD, this new kind of stablecoin will not inflate with USD. It's called IRMA - Inflation Resistant Medium of Account. Message me if you are curious about IRMA.     IRMA will be reserve-backed by the top six stablecoins in Solana: FDUSD, PYUSD, USDC, USDE, USDG, and USDT. This means that, even if USD does not inflate too much, IRMA would be very useful as a "universal stablecoin" that seamlessly and almost frictionlessly converts to/from the top six stablecoins. IRMA is the ultimate medium of exchange in DeFi. You won't need any other stablecoin in your wallet.      I am actively looking for investors and if you're looking for a stablecoin issuer to invest in, you're in luck because my startup Rock Stable has not accepted any formal investment. If you've found better inflation-resistant solutions elsewhere, I'd love to hear about it. The moat for IRMA is that it is patent pending. IRMA is open-source, but it is protected.	#REF!

Experiences: Goodfire (Co-Founder and CTO): Interpretability tooling for safe and reliable AI models | RippleMatch (Head of AI): Led R&D lifecycle from deep research through product integration for several high-scale AI features leveraging large language models. Highlights include:     - One feature led to cutting more than $1 million over two years in steady-state costs by automating 94% of work that humans were previously doing. These costs scaled linearly with business growth - so it's a very large reduction in cost over the long term.  - Another feature drove a 10% increase in conversions in a critical bottleneck through UX automation.   - A third drove a 25% cold conversion rate for a marketing splash page converting to on app signups by personalizing the splash page to the guest using AI.     My focus was on keen pragmatism in AI integrations. Ensuring that no matter what we built our eye was on driving value for the company and users.

(Standing recommender): I help investigate organizations that have applied for funding, to inform the Survival and Flourishing Fund's grant decisions. | Atlas Fellowship (Instructor): | Center for Applied Rationality (Instructor, Content Developer): CFAR is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that runs a variety of programs aiming to increase the quality of the epistemology around AI risk, via recruiting, training, and culture-setting.     We run workshops in conjunction with the Machine Intelligence Research Institute for recruiting talented computer scientists and mathematicians, helping those who are a good fit transition towards working on technical AI safety.      CFAR also runs a mainline workshop to which anyone can apply, where we teach many of the tools we've developed, and help people think clearly about the problems and opportunities in their life. There are ~15000 alumni of the mainline workshop, and many of those have continued to engage with the broader EA and rationality community. The mainline workshop is an important anchor of the epistemic culture around MIRI, and some parts of AI safety.     I teach at, and have developed curriculum for, all of CFAR's main programs including the mainline workshop, MSFP, and AIRCS. I also designed and led CFAR's 2019 instructor training.     In addition to workshops, I have done work on rationality development, specializing in methods for resolving deep disagreements of intuition, and efficient tacit knowledge transfer more generally.     My basic development loop involves:  - Identifying a problem that seems to be bottlenecking progress on some important dimension.   - Exploring the literature (if it exists) and other existing resources that are relevant to this domain and/or generating hypotheses for how to solve or circumvent the core problem.  - Running 2 to 8 person test sessions with volunteers, noticing where and how my intervention is failing, and iteratively trying to patch those problems.  - Deploying those tools, either by teaching the relevant researchers the cognitive skill directly, or by personally facilitating a process for them.     My sense of "what the problem is", and what sorts of interventions seem promising, usually changes drastically over the course of this process. | Survival and Flourishing Fund (Grant Evaluator): The Survival and Flourishing Fund is a Donor Advised Fund held at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, funded by Jaan Tallinn. The fund makes grants to organizations working to improve humanity's long term prospects for survival and flourishing.      I have done occasional grant assessment for the Survival and Flourishing fund, on a contract basis, since the fund was part of BERI.     This entails interviewing grant applicants and writing assessment and recommendation reports (of varying levels of depth, depending on the project), for the grant making committee. | Berkeley Existential Risk Initiative (Special Projects and HR): BERI is an independent 501(c)(3) public charity that takes on ethical and legal responsibility, as a collaborator, for projects deemed to be important for reducing existential risk. These projects mostly revolve around reducing risk from technologies that may pose significant civilization-scale dangers, as determined by research collaborators who have adopted existential risk reduction as both their primary career ambition and their primary area of intellectual focus.     I filled a variety of roles for BERI as the organization was growing, including:  - Interviewing, hiring, and onboarding contractors for several roles supporting researchers at academic x-risk focused orgs.  - Basic legal research  - Organizing and managing events  - Creating an open-use list of prediction market questions on AI outcomes.  - Evaluating grant applications, and making recommendations to the grants committee. | Center for Decision Research, Booth School of Business, University of Chicago (Research Assistant): Data collection and data coding of consumer behavior experiments. | Ben Radford (Paranormal Research and Investigation Intern): [Note: I no longer believe extra-physical psychic phenomena exist, and I am confident enough in this view that I don't think investigating parapsychology is very interesting or informative, in most cases.]     Once upon a time, I was seriously interested in parapsychology, psychic phenomena, and the content of "new-age" beliefs. I spent much of my teenage years pursuing this fascination and trying to develop my own psychic faculties. When I was 19, I was introduced to the scientific skepticism movement through a T.E.D. talk by James Randi. I had already begun testing the claims of the new-age thought bundle myself, and getting negative results. But I wanted to explore further, so I sought out a professional skeptic an paranormal investigator to intern with.]     Ben Radford is an editor for Skeptical Inquirer Magazine and an independent paranormal investigator, who has written several books on the topic, and who is most famous for having solved the mystery of the Chupacabra.     My work with Ben is largely research, tracking down sources and tracing the history of a claim. Doing your homework is the difference between a legitimate investigation and showing up at a site and declaring how spooky it is. Many cases are solved in the library.     I also worked on live field investigations, interviewing locals, running field-experiments on the fly, recording information. Most notably, I investigated the "Haunted" St. James Hotel in New Mexico.     This was classic detective work and investigative journalism. | Friendzy (Special Projects Intern): Friendzy was a Chicago-based start-up with the mission of helping people make friends. We identified the key pain-points and hurdles of the friendship-making process, and developed processes and strategies, and implemented them at our friednzy events, to make those traditional pain-points as smooth and easy as possible.      I worked on a number of projects, including developing low-cost, no-tech variants of technological tools (to serve as preliminary tests-of-concept before creating dedicated software), recording procedural variations and outcomes, running events, and writing instructional literature. | Point 180 (Sales Representative): A summer sales job, selling Vonage phones and phone-service in Wallmarts and k-marts.

While maintaining good grades and behaving, I was given a Nintendo Wii for Christmas. Being first introduced to entertainment, I found myself ensued on how these devices and video games have even came to start. I found myself playing customizable games like Super Mario Maker which gave me the ability to personalize video games myself. I found myself wanting to break barriers and traditional norms in video games.     As I began to grow accustomed to technology in everyday life, I began learning new ways to personalize other devices. I grew up with an Android tablet and found ways to root and customize the operating system of the tablet itself to fit my own personal needs and goals at the time. I found that there are ways to make a device more efficient by rooting android. I managed to learn to disable unneeded background tasks that sync information with other apps, and found ways to extend battery life to bring my tablet anywhere I needed to be instead of being stuck at home.     When I began to find work as a teenager, I found myself in the retail space and found a drive for providing the right solution for customers in the technology field. I grew astonished to find many different ways technology was able to assist others that may not be able to. From Live!y service to OTC hearing aids, I found myself interested and tried to think of new ways to get myself involved in the engineering field.     I took on a learning course and project from freecodecamp.org which taught me how to build websites with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I then honed those skills and learned to build a survey, which was built from the ground up with HTML and CSS to create a sense of professionalism, while also making it responsive, and adjust size and padding based on a device's resolution. The survey was meant to record data from a small group of individuals, which would record the biggest challenges they face navigating the internet and other technologies when considering their disabilities. I learned that there's many challenges that people still face regardless of given accessibility options.     I currently have a growing interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, as I, seeing the many accomplishments done with AI, believe that there can be more ways to make technology accessible to everyone, including voice recognition, voice recreation, and easier ways of communication. I'm hoping to develop this skill in order to find new ways to make technology accessible to all.	#REF!

I never studied them in college, I studied Civil Engineering instead. But during college, I gradually shifted my focus from Civil Engineering to AI. It affected my grades a lot, but I don’t regret it. I chose the right path. I still appreciate my Civil Engineering background. Someone once said something about connecting the dots I don't know if it was Steve Jobs or Elon Musk but I can say for sure: those engineering classes gave me a strong mathematical foundation that made learning and understanding AI much easier. This journey hasn't been easy. It's been full of moments of joy and laughter, but also failure. I’ve failed in two startups, but honestly, I consider startup life a school of thought on its own. Despite the setbacks, my passion for AI has never faded in fact, it’s only deepened.     Today, I’m a graduate student at WorldQuant University, pursuing a Master of Science in Financial Engineering, a path that combines my love for math, AI, and problem-solving in real-world systems.  I’m particularly passionate about how AI can uplift the less privileged, and I advocate for explainable, ethical, and responsible AI. My work is rooted in research, and it's through research that I’ve learned  the most. Being African, I’ve also observed how underrepresented we are in the global AI conversation. We’re often seen only as consumers, not creators. That needs to change. I’ve written on topics like balancing innovation and regulation, because overregulation can stifle progress especially, in places like  Africa where the ecosystem is just beginning to grow.     Currently, I work at MsingiAI, a research lab focused on democratizing AI access in Africa. All of our work is open source. I’ve been championing Open Source AI development in Africa, because I believe it’s the key to wider adoption, inclusion, and innovation across the continent. I don’t know exactly where this path will take me, but I’m optimistic. I love talking about AI, startups, and the African tech landscape. If you're into any of that, feel free to reach out via LinkedIn or email. I’ve got a lot to say probably enough for a book but for now, let me keep it short.     Cheers,  Korir	#REF!

Previously, I worked at Zetta AI, a startup that offers neural circuit reconstruction technology to research groups. I also ran a (somewhat) regular reading group in the EleutherAI discord server that discussed AI interpretability research with a focus on work relevant to AI existential safety. I often go by “Nick” (he/him/his).     Before that, I was a graduate student in the Seung Lab at Princeton University working on connectomics of tissue samples imaged by electron microscopy (EM). Most of my graduate work focused on synapse detection and assignment in EM volumes using convolutional networks. I built a software system for performing this task at scale, and our lab has also used the same system to perform automated segmentation of mitochondria and cell nuclei. I’ve also done some work on analyzing the connectivity patterns of cortical networks, and determining the cell types of ganglion cells in the mouse retina.     Before my graduate program, I did a research fellowship with Karen Berman at the NIMH using neuroimaging techniques. I analyzed diffusion-weighted imaging data to help characterize the white matter of children with Williams Syndrome, and analyzed gray matter volume distributions across typically developing volunteers.     The cover photo above represents collaborative work within the Seung Laboratory at Princeton. My contribution consists of adding synaptic connections (depicted as dots) to the reconstructed cell.	#REF!

I knew the difference a PV system and storage solution could make in my household.     When I had the opportunity to study abroad, I chose Appalachian State University for two reasons: they have the oldest renewable energy engineering and sustainable development program in the country, and they have a cycling team. This choice also ignited my other passions—health, fitness, and wellness. Additionally, Boone, NC, is one of the most beautiful mountain towns in the US. Those who have been there will agree.     At my core, I’m a problem solver. I believe no problem exists without a solution, and I love the challenge of finding solutions to audacious problems. Because of this, I’m also a solution architect. Big problems always have multiple moving parts, and solving difficult challenges has made me a highly structured, organized, and data-driven individual.     All of this made me very effective in my previous roles in sales and marketing, operations, engineering, design and installation, communication, business, product, and project development.     It also led me to co-found three organizations—two in renewable energy and one in health, fitness, and wellness. In all the organizations I led, we chose to create bold and exciting new products, services, and solutions rather than copying existing ones to make a quick buck. We engaged with potential users and stakeholders before creating a prototype of the solutions we eventually launched. Building something from nothing while working with an equally passionate cross-functional team provides the greatest highs for me.     I am currently looking for big, hairy problems to solve, preferably in the energy space, but I am open to challenges in the health, fitness, and wellness sectors as well.     I enjoy meeting new people and hearing new perspectives. Reach out if you want to talk to me about the above sectors or cycling.	#REF!
