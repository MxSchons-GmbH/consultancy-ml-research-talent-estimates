Question: Could this person design and implement complex ML architectures from scratch (e.g., transformers, VAEs, diffusion models) and is qualified for technical AI engineering or research? Quick Check: 
GOOD FIT - Look for: 
- Built neural networks or created novel architectures 
- Deep understanding demonstrated through: custom loss functions, attention mechanisms, or architecture modifications 
- Advanced degree in ML WITH thesis/research on model architecture (not just applications) 
- Implemented training algorithms or frameworks from scratch (not using existing libraries) 
- LLM/RLHF experience - distinguish between using vs. building these systems 

NOT A FIT - Reject if they're primarily: 
- Using pre-built models (even advanced ones like fine-tuning LLMs) 
- Data Scientists (dashboards, analytics, A/B tests) 
- MLOps/DevOps without architecture design 
- Hardware optimization for ML (GPU programming) without model design 
- Applied ML without evidence of understanding underlying math/algorithms 

Output: [ACCEPT/REJECT]
